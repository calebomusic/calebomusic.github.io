Stoa is a meditation app for practitioners and doers. It combines the practical philosophy of stoicism and mindfulness meditation.

Stoicism is "Buddhism with an attitude." It is a philosophy that has been adopted by entrepreneurs, athletes, psychologists, and politicians. 

With the 1+ hour guided meditations included with Stoa, you can practice the stoic disciplines and apply them to your life. 

Stoa begins by introducing the stoic disciplines of judgment, desire, and action. With the discipline of judgment is all about objective and accurate judgments. WIth the discipline of desire, we can relegate our desires to what is under our control. With the discipline of action, we can transform wants into action and act with purpose. By practicing these three disciplines, one can become happier and more effective. 

After completing the introductory sequence, we introduce more advanced stoic techniques such as the view from above, praemeditatio malorum, and meditations on death and gratitude.

In addition to guided meditations, Stoa includes a library of stoic quotes and principles.
