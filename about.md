This is me:

![Me](/img/Me.jpg)

I am an Frontend Engineering Intern at [Scaled Inference](http://scaledinference.com/). I spent two years studying philosophy at the [University of Notre Dame](https://philosophy.nd.edu/people/students/caleb-ontiveros/). Before then I was at Fort Lewis College in the great (greatest?) state of Colorado.

I write about philosophy, politics, programming, or about whatever else I happen to be interested in.
